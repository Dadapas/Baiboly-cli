These NFR terms and conditions apply to and govern the performance of any written OnApp order form that expressly incorporates them by reference (“Order Form”) that is agreed between OnApp Limited, of The Cooperage, Old Truman Brewery, 91 Brick Lane, London E1 6QL, (“OnApp”) and the “Customer” identified in an applicable Order Form, (“Licensee”), (individually referred to below as a “Party” and collectively as the “Parties”). The NFR Licence Agreement (as defined below) is effective from the “Start Date” stated in the applicable Order Form (“Effective Date”) and lasts for the “Initial term of Contract” set out in the applicable Order Form (as the same may be extended or amended “Evaluation Period”). The Licensee wishes to evaluate the OnApp product identified in the applicable Order Form (“Product”) for the purposes of determining whether it meets the Licensee’s requirements and OnApp is willing to allow the Licensee to use the Product in accordance with the terms of the NFR Licence Agreement and, where required, provide it with a licence key to enable Licensee do so (“Licence Key”). During and subject to this NFR Licence Agreement, OnApp may supply related services as agreed between the Parties in writing.

Access to and use of the Product by Licensee shall be subject to full execution of an applicable Order Form and shall be deemed to be an unconditional acceptance of the terms and conditions set out in this document and any additional specifications OnApp may provide in connection with the Product (such Order Form, these terms and conditions and any such additional specifications are collectively referred to as the “NFR Licence Agreement”).

Such Non-Production Use may but need not result in Feedback by Licensee to OnApp. “Feedback” means, measurement of access and use of Products, automatically generated and collected information and reports related to such access, use and operation (which may include personally identifiable data), and written comments, suggestions, observations, proposals, recommendations, opinions on, amongst other things: (i) potential improvements; and (ii) all problems, faults, errors, bugs, defects, difficulties, shortcomings, design faults, look and feel issues, usability performance, efficiency and reliability issues in operational performance. Licensee may, in its sole discretion, provide OnApp with Feedback. Licensee hereby assigns to OnApp all right, title, and interest in and to any Feedback, including all intellectual property rights therein or relating thereto.

1.2     Subject to the other terms and conditions of this NFR Licence Agreement including any additional restrictions imposed by OnApp at any time by written notice, during the Evaluation Period and in the territory of Licensee’s principal physical address set out in the applicable Order Form, OnApp hereby grants to the Licensee a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicenseable, fully paid up, royalty-free right and licence to (i) operate the Product and use any associated documentation (“Documentation”) for Licensee’s for Non-Production Use limited to the Authorised Purposes, unless otherwise stated in the applicable Order Form; and (ii) make one copy of it for back-up purposes; and (iii) permit third party contractors performing services on Licensee’s behalf to exercise the foregoing rights solely for the benefit of the Licensee and provided that Licensee shall be jointly and severally liable for all of their acts and omissions in respect of their use of the Product and Documentation (collectively, “Permitted Use”).

1.3     Except as expressly stated in Clause 1.2 or as expressly stated in an applicable Order Form, no other licence is granted to Licensee by implication, estoppel or otherwise. In particular, Permitted Use does not include the right to and Licensee agrees not to: (i) copy or use the Product outside the Evaluation Period or in any manner except as expressly permitted in this NFR Licence Agreement; (ii) attempt to circumvent, disable or defeat the limitations on Licensee’s Permitted Use of the Product, (iii) transfer, sell, rent, lease, distribute, sublicense, loan or otherwise transfer the Product in whole or in part to any third party; (iv) use the Product for providing time-sharing services, any software-as-a-service offering (“SaaS”), service bureau services or as part of an application services provider or as a service offering; (v) alter or remove any proprietary notices in the Product; (vi) make available to any third party any analysis of the results of operation of the Product, including benchmarking results, without the prior written consent of OnApp; or (vii) reverse engineer or decompile the Product except as permitted by applicable law. Licensee shall promptly notify OnApp of any unauthorized use, reproduction or distribution of the Product or Documentation of which it becomes aware.

1.6     Non-Production Use of the Product under the NFR Licence Agreement does not include and Licensee shall not have access to and OnApp shall have no obligation to provide any support in respect thereof. In OnApp’s sole discretion, Licensee may be able to email questions about Products used by it under the NFR Licence Agreement to the NFR email account. This account may be monitored by an account manager and/or sales engineer to provide limited support for the Permitted Use, in such manner and of such quality as OnApp may decide from time to time in its sole discretion.   Unless special permission is given by OnApp, Licensee’s ability to make Non-Production Use of certain features of the Product under the NFR Licence Agreement will be restricted/limited and such use in connection with other OnApp Limited products/services (such as CDN or Federation) will still require Licensee to add money into the OnApp Dashboard.

2.        PAYMENT
